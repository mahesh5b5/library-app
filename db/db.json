During the last century, the mean survival of human populations in developed countries has increased more than during the preceding 5000 years. This improvement in survival was accompanied by an increase in the number of active years. In other words, the increase in mean life span was accompanied by an increase in health span. This is now accentuated by progress in medicine reducing the impact of physiologic events such as menopause and of patho logical processes such as atherosclerosis. Up to now,research on aging, whether theoretical or experimental, has not contributed to improvement in human survival. Actually, there is a striking contrast between these significant modifications in survival and the present knowledge of the mechanisms of human aging. Revealed by this state of affairs are the profound disagreements between gerontologists in regard to the way oflooking at the aging process.

      "description": "Geography is a subject that throughout its history has been dominated by men; men have undertaken the heroic explorations that form the mythology of its foundation, men have written most of its texts, and, as many feminist geographers have remarked, men's interests have structured what counts as legitimate geographical knowledge. This book offers a sustained examination of the masculinism of contemporary geographical discourses. Drawing on the work of feminist theories about the intersection of power, knowledge and subjectivity, Rose discusses different aspects of the discipline's masculinism in a series of essays that bring influential approaches in recent geography together with feminist accounts of the space of the everyday, the notion of a sense of place, and views of landscape. In the final chapter, she examines the spatial imagery of a variety of feminists in order to argue that the geographical imagination implicit in feminist discussions of the politics of location is one example of a geography that does not deny difference in the name of a universal masculinity.",

This insightful text presents world regional geography as a way to comprehend the world’s connections and continuous interplay between features of place, populations, resources, cultures, and political systems. Retaining its balanced cultural and physical geographic perspectives on the world’s eight regions, the sixth edition includes new illustrations, examples, and cross-references to show students how human activities and natural processes reshape places and landscapes. From current information on the geographies of energy and terrorism to the repercussions of China’s booming economy, WORLD REGIONAL GEOGRAPHY, Sixth Edition, presents a meaningful context to help students grasp the geographic issues underlying today’s headlines. The result? Students develop their own deeper understanding of how the world works--and what can happen when natural events or human decisions make things go wrong.

      "description": "Since the first edition was published in 1992, there has been a tremendous amount of change in the arena of human services organizations. This book in many ways laid a critical framework of viewing human service organizations as a separate entity than mainstream organizations and management. It sets the foundation to view human services differently because human services organizations work on people and therefore have a different set of principles to take into consideration. It presented the idea of viewing human services organizations as organizations that process people as raw material (people processing or people changing). The new edition will pay particular attention to the cultural perspective and social justice as well as the feminist approach and the view that human services organizations are gendered (i.e., that mostly women work in human services except for men in management). It also will address the issue of advocacy and agents of social change.",
